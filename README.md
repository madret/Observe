# Observe
Observe collects all of your data, system and application logs, metrics, tracing spans, and any other kind of data then ingests them into a data lake. Then, depending on your individual use case, Observe curates the relevant event data into datasets. Datasets can be linked to other datasets to make it easy for you to access and correlate relevant context during an event investigation. You can then package up datasets, along with dashboards and alerting conditions(monitors), to produce Observe applications.
