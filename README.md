# Observe introduction
Observe collects all of your data, system and application logs, metrics, tracing spans, and any other kind of data then ingests them into a data lake. Then, depending on your individual use case, Observe curates the relevant event data into datasets. Datasets can be linked to other datasets to make it easy for you to access and correlate relevant context during an event investigation. You can then package up datasets, along with dashboards and alerting conditions(monitors), to produce Observe applications.

## Datastreams
Observe ingests event data using datastreams. Once ingested, all event data associated with a specific datastream populates a dataset. A datastream ingests data from multiple different sources with each source identified by a unique token. Individual tokens may be enabled, disabled, or deleted without impacting data associated with a different token on the same Datastream. This allows you to easily rotate datastream tokens.

## Datasets
Datasets are much like tables in a database. They consist of rows and columns of specific types. They can be linked, joined, and aggregated to derive insights. But unlike traditional tables, datasets automatically grow as Observe collects new data. Datasets are much like tables in a database. They consist of rows and columns of specific types.

## Key Concepts & Architecture
The key concepts of Observe, according to the documentation, are enabling the following tasks:

- Ingesting data into the Observe data lake using datastreams.
- Exploring the data that is in Observe.
- Live incident debugging using Live Mode.
- Visualizing data and presenting on dashboards.
- Using dashboards to view and filter datasets.
- Navigating between related datasets using GraphLink.
- Using worksheets and Observe Processing Analytics Language (OPAL) for manipulating event data.
- Installing Observe applications.
- Using the Dataset Graph feature to understand datasets and the relationships between them.

# Goal: Building an Observe intance with SIEM capabilities
- Security information and event management (SIEM)

## Requirements
- Setup free Observe trial: https://account.observeinc.com/

## Installation steps
1. Host Quickstart
2. Install Observe agent
3. Verify log ingestion

## 1. Host Quickstart
The Host Quick Start Integration is the simplest way to start monitoring your Linux and Windows endpoints in Observe. It is designed to quickly surface logs and metrics information in our Log and Metric explorers.
The package uses the **Observe Agent for Linux and Windows**, and **OpenTelemetry Collector [1]** with the Open Telemetry Host Metrics Receiver and the Open Telemetry File Log Receiver for MacOS to ship common logs and metrics from the host you wish to monitor.
The install is designed to be simple and light weight to simplify the process.
The instructions are located in a public git hub repository and are also provided (with pre-populated parameters to make it work for your Observe instance) within the Configuration panel of our UI based install for the app. 

Observe helps you quickly start monitoring the health and activity of your servers with the following features:
- A logs dataset (Logs) with log files being shipped from your host.
- A metrics dataset (Metrics) with common host metrics collected from your host.
- A resource dataset (Source) to quickly show you the hosts your are monitoring that links to associated logs and metrics.
- A simple home dashboard that shows high level logs and metrics with links to our log, metric and resource explorers.
- A simple health dashboard to monitor the health of the otelcol agent installed on your server.

## 2. Install observe agent
- Scope: Windows OS

The Observe agent, built on OpenTelemtry Collector can also be installed on Linux but i'm focussing on the Windows installation. Install the agent on the desired endpoint (e.g. server, windows VM, etc).

#### System requirements (WINOS)
Port 8888 should be open for HTTP connections from localhost (network access is not required). This port is used by the agent to monitor itself and the status command will not work if it is blocked.
The Observe Agent for WINOS supports x86_64 and arm64 architectures and the following platforms:
- Windows Server 2016+
- Windows 10

### WINOS Installation script
Install the observe-agent package via the provided installation powershell script. This script needs to be run in an elevated prompt (run as administrator). Replace `OBSERVE_TOKEN` and `OBSERVE_COLLECTION_ENDPOINT` with the appropriate values and run on each host.

```
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = "Tls, Tls11, Tls12, Ssl3"; Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/observeinc/observe-agent/main/scripts/install.ps1" -outfile .\install.ps1; .\install.ps1 -observe_token "${OBSERVE_TOKEN?}" -observe_collection_endpoint "${OBSERVE_COLLECTION_ENDPOINT?}"
```

#### Check Status
```Get-Service ObserveAgent
Set-Location "${Env:Programfiles}\Observe\observe-agent"
PS C:\Program Files\Observe\observe-agent> ./observe-agent status
```

#### Uninstall
```Stop-Service ObserveAgent
Remove-Item -Recurse "${Env:Programfiles}\Observe"
```

## 3. Explore and verify Log ingestion
Log Explorer displays a list of available Log Datasets logs. If you donâ€™t see the desired Datasets, use the **Search** function to locate it.
The left menu also displays a list of **Filters** to use with the currently selected **Logs dataset**. When you select a Filter, the Filter appears in the **Query Builder**.
In the center panel, you can build filters using the Query Builder and select from a dropdown list of parameters, or you can select **OPAL** and use OPAL to build your filter list.

By default, Log Explorer will show data in **Raw format** as log events. Selecting a row from the list of Logs displays details of the log in the right panel.
You can use column formatting tools to **filter, sort, and visualize** the data. Use a context-click on the column header to display options for working with data in a single column. The available options depend on the data type in the column. Refer to the Observe documentation.

# Parse, extract and interact with our data

![Picture1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/554871e3-a24d-4bcd-8295-d41011bf3ccc)

The Observe agent for WINOS in our case uses the Windows Event Log Receiver which tails and parses logs from windows event log API using the **opentelemetry-log-collection library**.
The Windows EventLog (EVTX) format is XML and is used by Microsoft Windows, as of Windows Vista, to store system log information. The EVTX format supersedes the Windows EventLog (EVT) format as used in Windows XP.

By default i'm not receiving the desired field extractions, i'm not aware of any potential wineventlog parsers out there and haven't build any myself (yet). 
Currently out of the box the entire windows event is in the body of the Log entry:

For a quick win and to get started with interacting with eventlog data, extract fields with the following regex for OPAL syntax:
```
extract_regex Body, /"channel":"(?P<channel>[^"]+)"/
extract_regex Body, /"level":"(?P<level>[^"]+)"/
extract_regex Body, /"event_source":"(?P<event_source>[^"]+)"/

## Dashboarding
Dashboards are a convenient way to visualize important data in one place.
